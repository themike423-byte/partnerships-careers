# Fix: Sheety Monthly Quota Reached

## The Problem
Your Sheety API has reached its monthly free quota limit. This is why jobs aren't loading.

## Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Upgrade Sheety (Easiest - $10/month)
1. Go to https://sheety.co/
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click "Upgrade" or "Plans"
4. Choose a paid plan (starts around $10/month)
5. Your API will work immediately after payment

**Pros:** Quick fix, no code changes needed
**Cons:** Costs money

---

### Option 2: Switch to Firebase Firestore (Free - Recommended)
Use Firebase Firestore instead of Sheety. It's free and has no quota limits for small apps.

**Pros:** 
- Completely free
- No quota limits
- More reliable
- Better for production

**Cons:** 
- Requires code changes (I can help with this)
- Need to migrate existing jobs

---

### Option 3: Wait Until Next Month
If you don't need the site working right now, you can wait until next month when the quota resets.

**Pros:** Free
**Cons:** Site won't work until quota resets

---

### Option 4: Use Google Sheets API Directly (Free but Complex)
Use Google Sheets API directly instead of Sheety.

**Pros:** Free
**Cons:** More complex setup, requires Google Cloud setup

---

## My Recommendation

**Option 2 (Firebase Firestore)** is the best long-term solution because:
- It's free forever (for reasonable usage)
- More reliable than Sheety
- Better performance
- No quota issues
- Already part of your tech stack

Would you like me to convert your website to use Firebase Firestore instead of Sheety? It will take about 10 minutes and I can do it for you.
