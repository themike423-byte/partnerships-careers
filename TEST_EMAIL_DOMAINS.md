# Test Email Domains

Here are free email services you can use for testing (these are NOT personal email domains, so they'll work for employer accounts):

## Free Business Email Services

1. **Zoho Mail** - https://www.zoho.com/mail/
   - Free for up to 5 users
   - Custom domain support
   - Example: `test@yourdomain.com`

2. **ProtonMail** - https://proton.me/mail
   - Free tier available
   - Professional email addresses
   - Example: `test@protonmail.com` (but this might be blocked as personal)

3. **Mail.com** - https://www.mail.com/
   - Free email with business-like domains
   - Domains: `@mail.com`, `@email.com`, `@usa.com`, `@consultant.com`, `@post.com`
   - Example: `test@consultant.com`

4. **Tutanota** - https://tutanota.com/
   - Free secure email
   - Example: `test@tutanota.com` (might be blocked)

5. **Temp Mail Services** (for quick testing):
   - https://temp-mail.org/
   - https://10minutemail.com/
   - These give you temporary email addresses

## Recommended Approach

For testing, I recommend using **Mail.com** with one of their business-like domains:
- `@consultant.com`
- `@post.com` 
- `@usa.com`
- `@email.com`

These should NOT be blocked as personal email domains.

## Testing Workflow

1. Sign up at mail.com with a business-like domain
2. Use that email to sign up for your employer account
3. Each unique email domain will create a separate company
4. First user from each domain becomes admin

## Note

The code blocks these personal domains:
- gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com, icloud.com, mail.com, protonmail.com, aol.com, live.com, msn.com, ymail.com, zoho.com

So use domains that are NOT in that list, or use a custom domain if you have one.
